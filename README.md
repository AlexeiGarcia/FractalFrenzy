# FractalFrenzy

FractalFrenzy is an interactive program that allows the user to explore the complex fractals created by the Mandelbrot Set.

A fractal is an infinitely complex pattern that is similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop, driven by recursion.

Compile FractalFrenzy.java and FractalMain.java in your preferred java IDE to run the program.
